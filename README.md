# LeetcodeReverseNodesInKGroup
My solution to the leetcode https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/ HARD problem


##First attempt:

Runtime: 100 ms, faster than 61.31% of C# online submissions for Reverse Nodes in k-Group.
Memory Usage: 27.4 MB, less than 10.26% of C# online submissions for Reverse Nodes in k-Group.

##Running **the same code** again with **absolutely zero changes** I got:

Runtime: 92 ms, faster than 92.54% of C# online submissions for Reverse Nodes in k-Group.
Memory Usage: 27.2 MB, less than 22.14% of C# online submissions for Reverse Nodes in k-Group.


##Third attempt:

I refactored the code to be clean(er). I hope you now can follow what it does. I got a nice wee speed increase at the expense of memory use!

There's always the trade-off....

Runtime: 88 ms, faster than **96.27%** of C# online submissions for Reverse Nodes in k-Group.

Memory Usage: 27.7 MB, less than 5.59% of C# online submissions for Reverse Nodes in k-Group.


I'm happy with the speed. As long as you can understand the code the memory considerations are secondary.

Don't be a cheat!
